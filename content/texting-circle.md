# Become a Texting Circle Hub

Help spread the word, one conversation at a time.

**Texting Circles** are a new way to power our campaign—by turning trusted volunteers like you into message hubs. You’ll get updates directly from us and forward them to people you know. Simple. Human. Powerful.

---

## 📣 How It Works

1. **Sign up** to become a hub. We’ll ask for your name, city, and phone number.
2. **Receive short messages** from our team—like voting reminders or important campaign news.
3. **Send it onward** to your friends, family, or coworkers—*people who trust you*.
4. **Encourage others** to sign up and start their own texting circles.

## 💡 Why It Matters

- People trust people—not ads or bots.
- Every text you send has power: to inform, connect, inspire.
- It’s one of the most effective ways to fight misinformation and mobilize voters.
