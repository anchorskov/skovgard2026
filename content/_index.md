### Conservative Republican for U.S. Senate  
**Rooted in Wyoming. Powered by Us. Zero Experience.** 

---

#### I’ve pledged to do three things in Washington:
1. **Sponsor and fight for term limits** for the House and Senate  
2. **Bring Wyoming’s voice — your voice — to Congress** using secure, modern tech 
3. **Represent you**  

---

Let’s face it — Washington has stopped listening.

I feel it too. You’re not alone. You’re not wrong.

I’m **Jimmy Skovgard**, born and raised here.  
* Great-grandfather Simon homesteaded near Basin in 1909  
* Greybull grade school → Basin High School → University of Wyoming  
* Twelve years of service in the Wyoming Army National Guard, honorably discharged as a captain  
* Zero political connections. Zero experience. Just a clean slate. My only agenda your voice.

I’m running because Wyoming deserves:

* Your voice  
* Accountability over showmanship  
* Limited government over endless growth  
* Service over self-promotion  

I’m not here to play a part. I’m here to **do the job** — listen, represent, restore trust.

**This is your seat. This is your future.**  
Let’s reclaim it together.

**In Wyoming, if we need something, we build it.**
