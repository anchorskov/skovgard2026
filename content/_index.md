### Conservative Republican for U.S. Senate  
**Rooted in Wyoming. Powered by Us. Zero Experience.** 

---

#### Iâ€™ve pledged to do three things in Washington:
1. **Sponsor and fight for term limits** for the House and Senate  

<p><strong><a href="/pledge/" style="font-size: 1.5em;">ðŸ‘‰ View my signed Term Limits Pledge</a></strong></p>

2. **Bring Wyomingâ€™s voice â€” your voice â€” to Congress** using secure, modern tech  
3. **Represent you**

Letâ€™s face it â€” Washington has stopped listening.

I feel it too. Youâ€™re not alone. Youâ€™re not wrong.

Iâ€™m **Jimmy Skovgard**, born and raised here.  
* Great-grandfather Simon homesteaded near Basin in 1909.  
* Greybull grade school â†’ Basin High School â†’ University of Wyoming.  
* Twelve years of service in the Wyoming Army National Guard, honorably discharged as a captain.  
* Zero political connections. Zero experience. Just a clean slate. My only agenda your voice.

Iâ€™m running because Wyoming deserves:

* Your voice  
* Accountability over showmanship.  
* Limited government over endless growth.  
* Service over self-promotion.  

Iâ€™m not here to play a part. Iâ€™m here to **do the job** â€” listen, represent, restore trust.

**This is your seat. This is your future.**  
Letâ€™s reclaim it together.

**In Wyoming, if we need something, we build it.**
