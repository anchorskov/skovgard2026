### Conservative Republican for U.S. Senate  
**Rooted in Wyoming. Powered by Us.**

---

#### I’ve pledged to do two things in Washington
1. **Sponsor and Fight for term-limits** for the House and Senate  
2. **Bring Wyoming’s voice Your voice to Congress** using secure, modern tech

---

Let's face it Washington has stopped listening. 
Nothing is being done and no-one is listening.  
I feel it to we're not alone, you’re not wrong.

I’m **Jimmy Skovgard**, born and raised here.  
* Great-grandfather Simon homesteaded near Basin in 1909  
* Greybull grade school → Basin High School → University of Wyoming  
* Twelve-year service in the Wyoming Army National Guard,  honorably discharged as a captain  

I’m running because Wyoming deserves:

* Accountability over showmanship  
* Limited government over endless growth  
* Service over self-promotion  

I’m not here to play a part. I’m here to **do the job**—listen, represent, restore trust.

**This is your seat. This is your future.**  
Let’s reclaim it together.

**In Wyoming if we need something we build it.**
