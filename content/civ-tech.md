description: "Harnessing secure, open-source tools to amplify Wyoming’s voice in Washington."

We’re integrating secure, modern technology into our campaign—and building an enduring civic platform beyond it.

Not a slogan. A commitment.

A commitment that every Wyomingite can contribute to policy through a secure, open-source forum. That aggregates our voices, when we agree we will be heard.

This is about you. Everyone.

## Why Civ-Tech

Congress listens to the loudest. We’re leveling the playing field.

Imagine a civic tool that is:

- **Secure** from tampering  
- **Open-source** for anyone to inspect and improve  
- **Accessible** to students, veterans, and seniors  
- **Responsive** to real-time feedback  
- **Trustworthy** because every record is verifiable  

This goes beyond technology.  
This is about **restoring trust** in our democracy.

Because the best ideas come from honest conversation and shared solutions.

## Who Benefits

- Voters who feel unheard  
- Teachers seeking real-world civic examples  
- Citizens who’ve written their representatives—without reply  
- Public servants committed to transparency  
- Future generations watching how we act  

This is our movement.  
**This is Us.**

## Our Principles

We believe:

- **Truth matters**—combat disinformation  
- **Term limits matter**—end career politicians  
- **Discourse matters**—civil debate builds progress  
- **Local voices matter**—Wyoming guides national choices  

We reject:

- Authoritarian shortcuts  
- Surveillance disguised as safety  
- Political theater over genuine representation
