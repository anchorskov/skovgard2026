## About Jimmy Skovgard  
### For Wyoming. For Us.  

I’m Jimmy Skovgard — a fifth-generation Wyomingite, husband, father, veteran, and now, candidate for the U.S. Senate.

I grew up in the Big Horn Basin — grade school in Greybull, high school in Basin, and college at the University of Wyoming. My great-grandfather, Simon Skovgard, homesteaded near Basin in 1909. Like many of us, I was raised to work hard, speak the truth, and take responsibility for my actions.

I served 12 years in the Wyoming Army National Guard and was honorably discharged as a captain. I’ve worked in the private sector, run my own business, and spent my life grounded in Wyoming values.

But I never planned to run for office.  
Until Washington stopped listening.

### Why I’m Running  

This isn’t about party politics or career ambition. It’s about principle.  
It’s about us — the people of Wyoming — being seen, heard, and respected again.

We don’t need more grandstanding in Congress.  
We need service.  
We need accountability.  
We need tools that bring our voices to the table — not more backroom deals.

That’s why I’ve pledged to:

- **Sponsor term limits** for the House and Senate  
- **Use modern, secure technology** to give Wyomingites a direct voice in D.C.  
- **Listen first. Represent always.**

### No Political Experience — and That’s the Point  

I bring no strings, no debts, and no ties to the political machine.  
I’m running with a clean slate — and a full heart — because I believe we can do better.

In Wyoming, when something’s broken, we don’t wait around.  
We fix it.  
We build it.  
We stand up and lead.

This seat belongs to the people.  
It’s time to bring it home.
